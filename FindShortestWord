I find my solution is pretty much old school as I see others just use one line of code and it kinda frustrates me;

for this one i defined a varialble with a huge number(tried PostiveInfinity Like Infinity in JS but it didn't work)
Then I split the big string using the spaces and then looped through each word in the list.

then simply I put conditional statment of any of the words starting from the begining has a smaller length than the variable smallest i created early then this samalled will be equals this word length


public class Kata
{
  public static int FindShort(string s)
  {
    var smallest = 1000;
    
    var listSt = s.Split(' ');
    
    foreach(var word in listSt) {
      
      if(smallest > word.Length) {
        smallest = word.Length;
      }
    }
    return smallest;
  }
}
