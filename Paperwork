Problem:
Your classmates asked you to copy some paperwork for them. You know that there are 'n' classmates and the paperwork has 'm' pages.
Your task is to calculate how many blank pages do you need.

Inputs: number of studends & number of pages in the paperwork
Output: number of balnk pages required fro all the students 

Example:
Paperwork(5, 5) == 25

Data Structure:

If we have n of students that need the paper work and the original had m number of pages 
so n*m will give us the total number of blank pages required to solve the problem

Algorithm:

will start with a conditional statment stating that if n or m is < zero
then return 0;
else return n*m


Code:


  using System;
  public static class Paper
  {
    public static int Paperwork(int n, int m)
    {
      if(n < 0 || m < 0) {
        return 0;
      }
      return n*m;
    }
    
  }
