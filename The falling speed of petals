When it's spring Japanese cherries blossom, it's called "sakura" and it's admired a lot. The petals start to fall in late April.

Suppose that the falling speed of a petal is 5 centimeters per second (5 cm/s), and it takes 80 seconds for the petal to reach the ground from a certain branch.

Write a function that receives the speed (in cm/s) of a petal as input, and returns the time it takes for that petal to reach the ground from the same branch.

Notes:

The movement of the petal is quite complicated, so in this case we can see the velocity as a constant during its falling.
Pay attention to the data types.
If the initial velocity is non-positive, the return value should be 0


Problem: 
To find the the time required for a petal to fall from a tree if we already have the speed as input

input: speed, height 

output: time


examples:

input: Speed = 5 cm/s.  // at this point we need to calculate the height of the branch which will be the same height inside our function

height = 400 cm

output = 80 seconds


Data structure:

we need to calculate the height of the branch first as it will be fixed in our function
then we will defined it as a variable in our function then make simple formula to get the 
speed from dividing the height in cms over speed


Algorism 

we will start by defining a variable called height inside our function to hold the height value
then we will return the height divided by the input speed to get the total time 



Code:

using System;

public static class Kata
{
  public static double SakuraFall(double v)
  {
    var height = 400;
    
    return height / v;
  }
}
